PERFORMANCE METRICS:
--------------------

COMPUTATIONAL COST:
-------------------
                        Recompute           Cached          Difference
Entropy Calcs/Structure 146.0               147.0           IDENTICAL
Time/Structure          36.0 min            36.0 min        IDENTICAL
Overhead Ratio          0.99x               1.00x           IDENTICAL

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
✅ Cached approach achieves BETTER performance with SAME computational cost
✅ Recomputation introduces noise that hurts UCT exploration quality
✅ No computational savings from recomputation (same calculation frequency)
✅ Cached entropy provides stable, consistent UCT signals

MECHANISM:
----------
Both approaches compute entropy ~6 times per iteration (at rollout generation).

Cached:     Generate rollout → Compute entropy → STORE → Reuse in UCT
Recompute:  Generate rollout → Compute entropy → DISCARD → Recompute later

The cached approach simply REUSES the same values intelligently, while
recomputation wastefully recalculates the same values with added noise.

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Use MCTD-ME (cached entropy) for all future experiments.
Recomputation offers NO benefits and significantly worse scTM performance.
