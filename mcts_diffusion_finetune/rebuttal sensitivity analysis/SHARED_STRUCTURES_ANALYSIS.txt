Structure-focused configurations show MORE CONSISTENT scTM improvements
across diverse structures, indicating robust structural optimization.


RECOMMENDATIONS (Based on Shared Structures)
=============================================

1. FOR MAXIMUM scTM IMPROVEMENT:
   Use Structure Slight Edge (0.40/0.55/0.05)
   → scTM +0.1740 (best structural similarity)
   → Acceptable AAR trade-off (-0.0257)

2. FOR BALANCED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION:
   Use Equal Balance (0.48/0.48/0.05)
   → scTM +0.1278 (strong structural improvement)
   → AAR +0.0010 (maintains sequence)
   → Reward +0.0607 (best overall balance)

3. FOR MAXIMUM AAR IMPROVEMENT:
   Use Biophysical Strict (0.45/0.30/0.25)
   → AAR +0.0241 (best sequence recovery)
   → scTM +0.0752 (good structural improvement)
   → Strong biophysical constraints

4. FOR GENERAL PROTEIN ENGINEERING:
   Use Baseline (0.60/0.35/0.05) OR Equal Balance (0.48/0.48/0.05)
   → Both achieve positive improvements in all metrics
   → Equal Balance offers better scTM at minimal AAR cost

Observations:
• Trends are CONSISTENT between all structures and shared structures
• Shared structures show slightly better baseline performance (more challenging)
• Pareto trade-offs remain clear and significant in both analyses


CONCLUSION
==========

The shared structures analysis (N=14, identical test set) CONFIRMS all major
findings from the full analysis:

✓ Clear Pareto trade-off between AAR and scTM (statistically significant)
✓ Structure-focused weights achieve 3.7x better scTM at cost of AAR
✓ Balanced weights (Equal Balance) achieve best multi-objective performance
✓ Biophysical constraints can be incorporated effectively
✓ Method responds predictably to weight changes (not "secret sauce")

The composite reward is a TRANSPARENT, TUNABLE multi-objective optimization
tool. Users should select weights based on their specific design objectives:
• Sequence-critical → High w_AAR (0.70-0.80)
• Structure-critical → High w_scTM (0.55-0.80)
• Balanced → Equal weights (0.48/0.48) or Baseline (0.60/0.35)

No single configuration is universally optimal. The choice depends on the
application and relative importance of sequence vs structure objectives.
